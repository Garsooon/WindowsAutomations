# WindowsAutomations

A small compilation of bat files I use on my install of windows 10 to automate tedious tasks.

## Installation & Usage

Installing and using the scripts is easy as .bat files use Windows' inbuilt command prompt to work. Simply download the Zip file from the releases tab, unzip and then run the file you would like to use.
